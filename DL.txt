Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks 
with multiple abstraction layers. Modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, specifically 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables 
organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.

Deep learning has been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, 
audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, and board game programs.
