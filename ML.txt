Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of computer programs 
that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, 
such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions 
in the future based on the examples that we provide.

The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. 
Some machine learning methods are based on neural networks with many layers, known as deep learning.
