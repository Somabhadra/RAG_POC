Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine 
that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is designed and trained for a particular task. 
Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, 
describes programming that can replicate the cognitive abilities of the human brain.
